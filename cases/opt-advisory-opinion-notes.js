addNote("para-90", "Oscar Pearce", "This paragraph expresses the traditional test for applying the law of occupation. Even here, however, the phrase \"to the extent that\" a state exercises effective control signals the shift to functional interpretation below.", "", "");
addNote("para-92", "Oscar Pearce", "The latter half of this paragraph reflects a shift towards the 'Functional Approach' to the law of occupation, supported by the ICRC and various academic/NGO commentators. See, in particular, 'The Writing on the Wall', Aeyal Gross (CUP, 2017), and Gross's response to this opinion: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=functional+approach+lex+lata&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8.", "", "");
addNote("para-94", "Oscar Pearce", "See Tatjana Grote's Opinio Juris article for a criticism of the Court's use of 'effective control' in this paragraph. The best interpretation is that effective control still functions as an absolute threshold (a state that has effective control must comply with the entirety of the law of occupation), while the functional approach allows certain obligations to remain in place even when control dips below that threshold. See: https://opiniojuris.org/2024/09/19/the-janus-face-of-effective-control-the-icjs-approach-to-determining-the-applicability-of-the-law-of-occupation-in-gaza-after-the-israeli-withdrawal/.", "", "");
addNote("para-229", "Oscar Pearce", "The Court's reluctance here to specify whether Israel is practicing apartheid, racial segregation, or both, has caused some confusion and debate. See: https://www.ejiltalk.org/racial-segregation-and-apartheid-in-the-icj-palestine-advisory-opinion/.", "", "");
addNote("para-251", "Oscar Pearce", "This paragraph endorses the strict, conventional separation between the jus ad bellum and jus in bello. As such, one would expect the subsequent paragraphs to assess the occupation under the jus ad bellum, with reference to the plausibility of Israel's claims of self-defence. Instead, the Court has focused on Israel's sustained violations - creating some confusion as to the basis of its eventual conclusion that Israel's presence in the OPT is illegal. See https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5284696.", "", "");
addNote("para-261", "Oscar Pearce", "This is a crucial paragraph, and one that is not explicitly reconciled with the Court's statement of law at paragraph 251. Again, see https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5284696.", "", "");
addNote("para-274", "Oscar Pearce", "It is notable, and perhaps disappointing that the Court framed this analysis in terms of  erga omnes  obligations rather than  jus cogens . See Judge Tladi's separate opinion for the argument that these consequences are properly attached to the latter.", "", "");
addNote("para-278", "Oscar Pearce", "Where the next paragraph seems to draw on the duty in Article 41 of the ILC's Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, this paragraph instead echoes the obligations customarily associated with the specific prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force.", "", "");
addNote("para-279", "Oscar Pearce", "Though the Court refrained from explicitly invoking it, these obligations seem to fit Article 41 of the ILC's Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Act. Note that this provision applies to serious violations of peremptory norms.", "", "");
addNote("para-281", "Oscar Pearce", "To this end, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution acknowledging and affirming the Court's Opinion while calling for further specific measures, including states 'taking steps towards ceasing' any trade in arms and products originating in Israeli settlements. See https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/", "", "");
addNote("para-285", "Oscar Pearce", "Vice-President Sebutinde - the most resounding dissenting voice in this Opinion - has since attracted controversy for her comment that '[t]he Lord is counting on me to stand on the side of Israel'. See https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/why-icj-judge-sebutinde-faces-calls-to-quit-from-israel-genocide-case.", "", "");
