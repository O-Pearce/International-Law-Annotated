Rather, as is even more explicit in their application instituting proceedings, they consider Germany's pre-2023 support for Israel to also be unlawful. This position has been lended greater weight by the Advisory Opinion issued by the Court months later finding that Israel had perpetrated - and was continuing to perpetrate - various IHRL and IHL violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.", "", "");

Those that adopt that more radical stance contend that the duty to ensure respect for IHL extends only to those under a state's direct influence (ie, individuals, corporations, etc).", "", "");
addNote("para-18", "Oscar Pearce", "This decrease in exports from Germany reversed in the aftermath of this decision, which could undermine Germany's case at the merits stage of these proceedings. See Judge Tladi's declaration, and this article: https://www.justsecurity.org/114479/german-arms-exports-israel-icj/.", "", "");

Israel is not a party to these proceedings despite arguably having legal interests at stake (ie, in a hypothetical finding that it is committing certain violations).", "", "");
