Rather, as is even more explicit in their application instituting proceedings, they consider Germany's pre-2023 support for Israel to also be unlawful. This position has been lended greater weight by the Advisory Opinion issued by the Court months later finding that Israel had perpetrated - and was continuing to perpetrate - various IHRL and IHL violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.", "", "");

Those that adopt that more radical stance contend that the duty to ensure respect for IHL extends only to those under a state's direct influence (ie, individuals, corporations, etc).", "", "");
